# Code Refractor Module 1

* On the first group section I replace div with header because it follows the semanatic structure while replacing the div inside the div with nav because it provides navigation for links on the web page.

* Change the div parent to main to follow semanatic structure to represent the dominant content of the body. I also introduce section around the main articles because it helps the standalone section of a document. Article was use to replace div to help contain the image and description.

* The final adjustment to the HTML is the footer at the end of the main to display the copyright data.

# CSS Refractor Module 1

* I combine the benefit lead, brand and cost into one line because all three styles were using the same display, margin and width. Same for Img and titlessearch-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing becusae they displayed the same style. The final stye I added was footer becuase it added in HTML.
